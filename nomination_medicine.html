                <p>The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet is responsible for the selection of the Nobel Prize
                    laureates
                    in physiology or medicine from among the candidates recommended by the Nobel Committee for
                    Physiology or
                    Medicine. The Nobel Assembly has 50 members. The Nobel Committee is the working body that reviews
                    the
                    nominations and selects the candidates. It consists of five members and the Secretary of the Nobel
                    Committee and Nobel Assembly.</p>
                <h3>Who is eligible for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine?</h3>
                <p>Candidates eligible for the medicine prize are those nominated by nominators who have received an
                    invitation from the Nobel Committee to submit names for consideration. No one can nominate herself
                    or
                    himself.</p>
                <h2 class="wr-block-title">How are the Nobel Prize laureates selected?</h2>
                <p>The Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine is awarded for discovery of major importance in life
                    science
                    or medicine. Discoveries that have changed the scientific paradigm and are of great benefit for
                    humankind are awarded the prize, whereas life time achievements or scientific leadership cannot be
                    considered for the Nobel Prize.</p>
