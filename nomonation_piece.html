                    <p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of eligible candidates and the
                        choice of the Nobel Peace Prize laureates. The Committee is composed of five members appointed
                        by the Storting (Norwegian parliament). The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway, not in
                        Stockholm, Sweden, where the Nobel Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine,
                        Literature and the prize in economic sciences are awarded.</p>

                    <p>Below is a brief description of the process involved in selecting the Nobel Peace Prize
                        laureates.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>September – </b>
                        <i>The Norwegian Nobel Committee prepares to receive nominations. </i>
                        These nominations will be submitted by members of national assemblies, governments, and
                        international courts of law; university chancellors, professors of social science, history,
                        philosophy, law and theology; leaders of peace research institutes and institutes of foreign
                        affairs; previous Nobel Peace Prize laureates; board members of organisations that have received
                        the Nobel Peace Prize; present and past members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee; and former
                        advisers of the Norwegian Nobel Institute.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>February –</b>
                        <i>Deadline for submission. </i>
                        In order to be considered for the award of the year, nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize shall
                        be sent in to the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo before the 1st day of February the same
                        year. Nominations postmarked and received after this date are included in the following year’s
                        discussions. In recent years, the Committee has received close to 200 different nominations for
                        different nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. The number of nominating letters is much
                        higher, as many are for the same candidates.
                    </p>

                        At the beginning of October, the Nobel Committee chooses the Nobel Peace Prize laureates through
                        a majority vote. The decision is final and without appeal. The names of the Nobel Peace Prize
                        laureates are then announced.

                    <p>
                        <b>December – </b>
                        <i>Nobel Prize laureates receive their prize. </i>
                        The Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony takes place on 10 December in Oslo, Norway, where the
                        laureates receive their Nobel Prize, which consists of a Nobel Prize medal and diploma, and a
                        document confirming the prize amount.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Are the nominations made public?</h3>
                    <p>The statutes of the Nobel Foundation restrict disclosure of information about the nominations,
                        whether publicly or privately, for 50 years. The restriction concerns the nominees and
                        nominators, as well as investigations and opinions related to the award of a prize.</p>
                </div>
                <h2 class="wr-block-title">Submission</h2>
                <h3>Submission of nominations</h3>
                <p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee has launched an on-line nomination form that you can use if you are a
                    qualified nominator (see the list ‘Qualified nominators’) above). The form can be reached from the
                    website of the Norwegian Nobel Committee between September and February.</p>
                <h3>Deadline for nominations</h3>
                <p>Nomination deadline is 31 January at 12 midnight CET. Nominations which do not meet the deadline are
                    normally included in the following year’s assessment. Members of the Nobel Committee are entitled to
                    submit their own nominations as late as at the first meeting of the Committee after the expiry of
                    the deadline.</p>
                <div class="read-more">
                    <h2 class="wr-block-title">Selection process</h2>
                    <p>At the first meeting of the Nobel Committee after the February 1 deadline for nominations, the
                        Committee’s Permanent Secretary presents the list of the year’s candidates. The Committee may on
                        that occasion add further names to the list, after which the nomination process is closed, and
                        discussion of the particular candidates begins. In the light of this first review, the Committee
                        draws up the so-called short list – i.e. the list of candidates selected for more thorough
                        consideration. The short list typically contains from twenty to thirty candidates.</p>
                    <p>The candidates on the short list are then considered by the Nobel Institute’s permanent advisers.
                        In addition to the Institute’s Director and Research Director, the body of advisers generally
                        consists of a small group of Norwegian university professors with broad expertise in subject
                        areas with a bearing on the Peace Prize. The advisers usually have a couple of months in which
                        to draw up their reports. Reports are also occasionally requested from other Norwegian and
                        foreign experts.</p>
                    <p>When the advisers’ reports have been presented, the Nobel Committee embarks on a thorough-going
                        discussion of the most likely candidates. In the process, the need often arises to obtain
                        additional information and updates about candidates from additional experts, often foreign. As a
                        rule, the Committee reaches a decision only at its very last meeting before the announcement of
                        the Prize at the beginning of October.</p>
                    <p>The Committee seeks to achieve unanimity in its selection of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate. On
                        the rare occasions when this proves impossible, the selection is decided by a simple majority
                        vote.</p>
                    <h3>50 year secrecy rule</h3>
                    <p>The Committee does not itself announce the names of nominees, neither to the media nor to the
                        candidates themselves. In so far as certain names crop up in the advance speculations as to who
                        will be awarded any given year’s prize, this is either sheer guesswork or information put out by
                        the person or persons behind the nomination. Information in the Nobel Committee’s nomination
                        database is not made public until after fifty years.</p>
