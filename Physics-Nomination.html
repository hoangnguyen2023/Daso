                <h2 class="wr-block-title">Selection of Nobel Prize laureates</h2>
                <p class="content-p">The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is responsible for the selection of the Nobel Prize laureates
                    in
                    physics. The Academy appoints a working body, the Nobel Committee for Physics, which screens the
                    nominations and presents a proposal for final candidates. The committee consists nominally of five
                    voting members, but since many years, it also includes voting adjunct members. The Committee’s
                    proposal
                    is discussed in a larger body, the Physics Class of the Academy, who may suggest a modification or
                    forward a different proposal to the Academy. Finally, additional proposals may be raised at the
                    final
                    Academy meeting. It is in principle possible to suggest that no Prize be given the current year, but
                    that is a seldom used choice.</p>
                <h3>Who is eligible for the Nobel Prize in Physics?</h3>
                <p class="content-p">The candidates eligible for the Physics Prize are those nominated by qualified persons who have
                    received
                    an invitation from the Nobel Committee to submit names for consideration. No one can nominate
                    himself or

                    <b>September – </b>
                    <i>Nomination forms are sent out.</i>
                    The Nobel Committee sends out confidential forms to around 3,000 people — selected professors at
                    universities around the world, Nobel Prize laureates in physics and chemistry, and members of the
                    Royal
                    Swedish Academy of Sciences, among others.

                    The completed nomination forms must reach the Nobel Committee no later than 31 January of the
                    following
                    year. The Committee screens the nominations and selects the preliminary candidates. About 250–350
                    scientists are nominated as several nominators often submit the same name.

                    their assessment of the candidates’ work.

                    The

                    of
                    the Academy. The report is discussed at two meetings of the Physics Class of the Academy.

                    The
                    decision is final and without appeal. The names of the Nobel Laureates are then announced.

                    laureates
                    receive their Nobel Prize, which consists of a Nobel Prize medal and diploma, and a document

                    the prize amount.

                <p class="content-p">The statutes of the Nobel Foundation restrict disclosure of information about the nominations,
                    whether
                    publicly or privately, for 50 years. The restriction concerns the nominees and nominators, as well
                    as
                    investigations and opinions related to the award of a prize.</p>
