            <h2 class="faq_heading" id="t1">The Nobel Prize</h2>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t4">Why is there a Nobel Prize?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">The Nobel Prize was set up when businessman and entrepreneur Alfred Nobel died
                and left the majority of his fortune to the establishment of prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or
                medicine, literature and peace. His will stated that the prizes should be awarded to “those who, during
                the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.”</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t5">Who was Alfred Nobel?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">Alfred Nobel was an inventor, entrepreneur, scientist and businessman who also
                wrote poetry and drama. His varied interests are reflected in the Nobel Prizes which he laid the
                foundation for in 1895 in his last will and testament.</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t6">How long have you been awarding Nobel Prizes?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">The first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901 and they have been awarded
                annually since then. There have been years in that time when the Nobel Prizes have not been
                awarded - mostly during World War I (1914-1918) and II (1939-1945).</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t7">What are the Nobel Prize categories?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">The Nobel Prize categories are physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine,
                literature and peace – these were laid out in the will of Alfred Nobel. In
                1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden’s central bank) established the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic
                Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t8">Why isn’t there a Nobel Prize in mathematics, engineering, biology or
                environmental science?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">The Nobel Prizes were designated in the will of Alfred Nobel and are in
                physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace. The economics prize was established
                much later and is a memorial prize, as indicated by its full name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in
                Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Its addition was an exception, to celebrate the
                tercentenary of Sweden’s central bank in 1968.</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t9">Why is the Nobel Peace Prize awarded in Norway?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">In his will Alfred Nobel laid out who he wanted to be responsible for the
                selection of the Nobel Prize laureates. The prizes were to be awarded by Swedish institutions – apart
                from the peace prize, whose award was to be decided by a committee of five persons elected by the
                Norwegian Parliament.</span><br>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">During Nobel’s lifetime Sweden and Norway were joined in a union but we still
                don’t know exactly why Alfred Nobel chose for the peace prize to be awarded in Norway. However as the
                prize committee is located in Oslo, it follows that the prize is also awarded there.</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t10">Where does the prize money come from?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">When Alfred Nobel died leaving the majority of his fortune to the
                establishment of the Nobel Prize he stated that the money should be converted into a fund and invested
                in “safe securities.” Today the interest earned on that money is used to fund the Nobel Prizes.</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t11">Is it possible to revoke a Nobel Prize?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">No. Neither Alfred Nobel’s will nor the statutes of the Nobel Foundation
                mention any such possibility.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="faq_answer">
            <h2 class="faq_heading">Nobel Prize laureates</h2>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t12">Why are they called Nobel Prize laureates?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">The word “laureate” refers to being signified by the laurel wreath. In ancient
                Greece, laurel wreaths were awarded to victors as a sign of honour. Put that together with the Nobel
                Prize and we get “Nobel Prize laureate”.</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t13">How many people can share the same Nobel Prize?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text" class="faq_answer_text">A Nobel Prize can be shared by up to three
                individuals, or in the case of the peace prize, it can also be awarded to an organisation. The rule that
                a prize can only be awarded to three people comes from the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, which is
                responsible for fulfilling the intentions of Nobel’s will. It specifically states: “In no case may a
                prize amount be divided between more than three persons.”</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t14">Can you award a prize posthumously?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">No, a Nobel Prize cannot be awarded posthumously.</span><br>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">However, since 1974, if the recipient dies after the prize has been announced
                they can still be awarded it. Previously, a person could be awarded a prize posthumously if they had
                already been nominated before 1 February of the same year, which was true of Erik Axel Karlfeldt (Nobel
                Prize in Literature 1931) and Dag Hammarskjöld (Nobel Peace Prize, 1961).</span><br>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">Following the 2011 announcement of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine,
                it was discovered that one of the medicine laureates, Ralph Steinman, had passed away three days
                earlier. The Board of the Nobel Foundation examined the statutes, and came to the conclusion that Ralph
                Steinman should continue to remain a Nobel Prize laureate, as the Nobel Assembly at
                Karolinska Institutet had announced the 2011 Nobel Prize laureates in physiology or medicine without
                knowing of his death.</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t15">Can someone affiliated with an organisation (like the EU or the IPCC)
                which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize claim to have received the honour?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">When an organisation is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize the organisation becomes
                the laureate, not the individuals working there. Therefore those people connected to or working for a
                Nobel Prize awarded organisation cannot in any way refer to themselves personally as a Nobel Prize
                laureate.</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t16">How do you look upon criticism of Nobel Peace Prize laureates after
                they have been awarded?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">For answers to this and other questions about the Nobel Peace Prize read our
                <a href="">Q&A with Olav Njølstad, Director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute.</a></span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t17">How can I contact a Nobel Prize laureate?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">The Nobel Foundation does not disclose addresses to Nobel Prize laureates out
                of courtesy. Please contact the institution, organisation or university to which the Nobel Prize
                laureate was affiliated at the time of the award. For literature laureates please contact their
                publishing house. Alternatively you may be able to contact some laureates via social media.</span>

            <h2 class="faq_heading" id="t2">How Nobel Prize laureates are chosen</h2>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t18">Who selects the Nobel Prize laureates?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">In his last will and testament, Alfred Nobel specifically designated the
                institutions responsible for the prizes he wished to be established.</span>
            <ul>
                <li>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for the Nobel Prize in Physics and Chemistry</li>
                <li>Karolinska Institutet (now The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet) for the Nobel Prize in
                    Physiology or Medicine</li>
                <li>The Swedish Academy for the Nobel Prize in Literature</li>
                <li>A committee of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Parliament (Storting) for the Nobel Peace
                    Prize.</li>
            </ul>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was
                instituted in 1968, on the tercentenary of the bank. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences was given the
                task of selecting the economic sciences laureates. It has been awarded since 1969 according to the same
                principles as the Nobel Prizes.</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t19">How do you become nominated for a Nobel Prize?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">In order to become a Nobel Prize laureate you must first be nominated for a
                prize by an eligible nominator. Self-nomination is not allowed. Except for the Nobel Peace Prize,
                nomination is by invitation only and nominators must fulfil the criteria set out by the
                awarding institutions.</span><br>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">Eligible nominations are then considered by the prize awarders, who make the
                final decision as to who will receive a Nobel Prize.</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t20">How can you become a nominator?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">Only people who fulfil the criteria set out by the prize awarding institutions
                are allowed to nominate candidates for the Nobel Prize.</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t21">Is being nominated an endorsement by the Nobel Prize?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">No. Hundreds or thousands of nominations are received for the Nobel Prize
                every year from members of academies, university professors, scientists, previous Nobel Prize laureates,
                members of parliamentary assemblies and more.</span><br>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">In theory anybody could be put forward for a prize and as such being nominated
                is in no way an endorsement by the Nobel Prize. That is reserved for those individuals and organisations
                that are selected as Nobel Prize laureates.</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t22">Are three nominations enough to be awarded the Nobel Prize?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">Frederick G. Banting and John Macleod were awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in
                Physiology or Medicine the first year they were nominated (with three nominations) for their discovery
                of insulin. By contrast, Robert Koch was nominated 55 times over 4 years before he received the prize in
                1905 for his discoveries concerning tuberculosis.</span>

            <span class="faq_answer_text">Nominations are only made public 50 years after the nomination has taken place
                – so nominations for this year’s Nobel Prizes are a closely guarded secret. Any rumours regarding recent
                nominees are either just rumour, or someone among the invited nominators has leaked information. Since
                the nominations are kept secret for 50 years, you’ll have to wait until then to find out.</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t25">Can an eligible nominator reveal who they have nominated for the Nobel
                Prize within 50 years?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">According to the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, information about the
                nominations is not to be disclosed, publicly or privately, for a period of fifty years. The restriction
                not only concerns the nominees and nominators, but also investigations and opinions in the awarding of a
                prize.</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t26">How do the committees decide who to award the prizes to?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">Every committee is slightly different but ultimately they all work
                to fulfil the will of Alfred Nobel which stated that the Nobel Prize should be awarded according to
                those who have “conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.”</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t27">Is it possible for a committee to look over my work?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">No, the committees cannot comment on work outside of their Nobel Prize
                responsibilities. It is not in the purpose of these committees to generally assess or evaluate any
                scientific or literary work beyond the assessment of nominations for the Nobel Prizes.</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t28">Do the Nobel Committees ever reconsider a choice?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">No. For the very same reasons a prize cannot be revoked. According to the
                statutes of the Nobel Foundation, § 10, “No appeals may be made against the decision of a prize-awarding
                body with regard to the award of a prize”.</span>
            <h3 class="faq_sub_heading" id="t29">What if the awarded inventions fail after some time, say two years
                later?</h3>
            <span class="faq_answer_text">A Nobel Prize cannot be revoked.</span>
