                <h2 class="wr-block-title">Selection of Nobel Prize laureates</h2>
                <p>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is responsible for the selection of the Nobel Prize laureates
                    in
                    Chemistry from among the candidates recommended by the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. The Nobel
                    Committee is the working body that screens the nominations and selects the final candidates. It
                    consists
                    of five members, but for many years the Committee has also adjunct members with the same voting
                    rights
                    as members.</p>
                <h3>Who is eligible for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry?</h3>
                <p>The candidates eligible for the Chemistry Prize are those nominated by qualified persons who have
                    received an invitation from the Nobel Committee to submit names for consideration. No one can
                    nominate
                    himself or herself.</p>

                <p>Below is a brief description of the process involved in selecting the Nobel Prize laureates in
                    Chemistry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>September-October – </b>
                    <i>Nomination forms are sent out.</i>
                    The Nobel Committee sends out confidential forms to around 3,000 people — selected professors at
                    universities around the world, Nobel Prize laureates in physics and chemistry, and members of the
                    Royal
                    Swedish Academy of Sciences, among others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>February –</b>
                    <i>Deadline for submission of nominations.</i>
                    The completed nomination forms must reach the Nobel Committee no later than 31 January of the
                    following
                    year. The Committee screens the nominations and selects the preliminary candidates. About 250–350
                    scientists are nominated as several nominators often submit the same name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>March-May –</b>
                    <i>Consultation with experts.</i>
                    The Nobel Committee evaluates preliminary candidates, advised by specially appointed experts for
                    their
                    assessment of the candidates’ work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>June-August –</b>
                    <i>Writing of the report. </i>
                    The Nobel Committee puts together a report with recommendations to be submitted to the Academy. The
                    report is signed by all members of the Committee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>September –</b>
                    <i>Committee submits recommendations.</i>
                    The Nobel Committee submits its report with recommendations on the final candidates to the members
                    of
                    the Academy. The report is discussed at two meetings of the Chemistry Section of the Academy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>October –</b>
                    <i>Nobel Prize laureates are chosen.</i>
                    In early October, the Academy selects the Nobel Prize laureates in chemistry through a majority
                    vote.
                    The decision is final and without appeal. The names of the Nobel Prize laureates are then announced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>December – </b>
                    <i>Nobel Prize laureates receive their Prize. </i>
                    The Nobel Prize Award Ceremony takes place on 10 December in Stockholm, where the Nobel Prize
                    laureates
                    receive their Nobel Prize, which consists of a Nobel Prize medal and diploma, and a document
                    confirming
                    the prize amount.
                </p>
                <h3>Are the nominations made public?</h3>
                <p>The statutes of the Nobel Foundation restrict disclosure of information about the nominations,
                    whether
                    publicly or privately, for 50 years. The restriction concerns the nominees and nominators, as well
                    as
                    investigations and opinions related to the award of a prize.</p>
