                    <h5>Process of nomination and selection</h5>
                    <p>Humanity has always been intrigued by its origins. Where do we come from, and how are we related
                        to those who came before us? What makes us, Homo sapiens, different from other hominins?</p>
                    <p>Through his pioneering research, Svante Pääbo accomplished something seemingly impossible:
                        sequencing the genome of the Neanderthal, an extinct relative of present-day humans. He also
                        made the sensational discovery of a previously unknown hominin, Denisova. Importantly, Pääbo
                        also found that gene transfer had occurred from these now extinct hominins to Homo sapiens
                        following the migration out of Africa around 70,000 years ago. This ancient flow of genes to
                        present-day humans has physiological relevance today, for example affecting how our immune
                        system reacts to infections.</p>
                    <p>Pääbo’s seminal research gave rise to an entirely new scientific discipline; paleogenomics. By
                        revealing genetic differences that distinguish all living humans from extinct hominins, his
                        discoveries provide the basis for exploring what makes us uniquely human.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="entry-page-content">
                    <h5>Where do we come from?</h5>
                    <p>The question of our origin and what makes us unique has engaged humanity since ancient times.
                        Paleontology and archeology are important for studies of human evolution. Research provided
                        evidence that the anatomically modern human, Homo sapiens, first appeared in Africa
                        approximately 300,000 years ago, while our closest known relatives, Neanderthals, developed
                        outside Africa and populated Europe and Western Asia from around 400,000 years until 30,000
                        years ago, at which point they went extinct. About 70,000 years ago, groups of Homo sapiens
                        migrated from Africa to the Middle East and, from there they spread to the rest of the world.
                        Homo sapiens and Neanderthals thus coexisted in large parts of Eurasia for tens of thousands of
                        years. But what do we know about our relationship with the extinct Neanderthals? Clues might be
                        derived from genomic information. By the end of the 1990’s, almost the entire human genome had
                        been sequenced. This was a considerable accomplishment, which allowed subsequent studies of the
                        genetic relationship between different human populations. However, studies of the relationship
                        between present-day humans and the extinct Neanderthals would require the sequencing of genomic
                        DNA recovered from archaic specimens.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="entry-page-content">
                    <h5>A seemingly impossible task</h5>
                    <p>TEarly in his career, Svante Pääbo became fascinated by the possibility of utilizing modern
                        genetic methods to study the DNA of Neanderthals. However, he soon realized the extreme
                        technical challenges, because with time DNA becomes chemically modified and degrades into short
                        fragments. After thousands of years, only trace amounts of DNA are left, and what remains is
                        massively contaminated with DNA from bacteria and contemporary humans (Figure 1). As a
                        postdoctoral student with Allan Wilson, a pioneer in the field of evolutionary biology, Pääbo
                        started to develop methods to study DNA from Neanderthals, an endeavor that lasted several
                        decades.</p>
                    <h5>Who is eligible for the Nobel Prize in Literature?</h5>
                    <p>The candidates eligible for the literature prize are those nominated by qualified persons (see
                        below) who have received an invitation from the Nobel Committee to submit names for
                        consideration. Other persons who are qualified to nominate but have not received invitations may
                        also submit nominations. No one can nominate himself or herself.</p>

                    <p>Figure 1. DNA is localized in two different compartments in the cell. Nuclear DNA harbors most of
                        the genetic information, while the much smaller mitochondrial genome is present in thousands of
                        copies. After death, DNA is degraded over time and ultimately only small amounts remain. It also
                        becomes contaminated with DNA from e.g. bacteria and contemporary humans.</p>

                    <p> In 1990, Pääbo was recruited to University of Munich, where, as a newly appointed Professor, he
                        continued his work on archaic DNA. He decided to analyze DNA from Neanderthal mitochondria –
                        organelles in cells that contain their own DNA. The mitochondrial genome is small and contains
                        only a fraction of the genetic information in the cell, but it is present in thousands of
                        copies, increasing the chance of success. With his refined methods, Pääbo managed to sequence a
                        region of mitochondrial DNA from a 40,000-year-old piece of bone. Thus, for the first time, we
                        had access to a sequence from an extinct relative. Comparisons with contemporary humans and
                        chimpanzees demonstrated that Neanderthals were genetically distinct.</p>
                    <h5>Sequencing the Neanderthal genome</h5>
                    <p>As analyses of the small mitochondrial genome gave only limited information, Pääbo now took on
                        the enormous challenge of sequencing the Neanderthal nuclear genome. At this time, he was
                        offered the chance to establish a Max Planck Institute in Leipzig, Germany. At the new
                        Institute, Pääbo and his team steadily improved the methods to isolate and analyze DNA from
                        archaic bone remains. The research team exploited new technical developments, which made
                        sequencing of DNA highly efficient. Pääbo also engaged several critical collaborators with
                        expertise on population genetics and advanced sequence analyses. His efforts were successful.
                        Pääbo accomplished the seemingly impossible and could publish the first Neanderthal genome
                        sequence in 2010. Comparative analyses demonstrated that the most recent common ancestor of
                        Neanderthals and Homo sapiens lived around 800,000 years ago.</p>

                    <p>Figure 2. A. Pääbo extracted DNA from bone specimens from extinct hominins. He first obtained
                        a bone fragment from Neandertal in Germany, the site that gave name to the Neanderthals.
                        Later, he used a finger bone from the Denisova Cave in southern Siberia, the site that gave
                        name to Denisovans. B. Phylogenetic tree showing the evolution and relationship between Homo
                        sapiens and the extinct hominins. The phylogenetic tree also illustrates the gene flows
                        discovered by Pääbo.</p>
                    <p>Pääbo and his co-workers could now investigate the relationship between Neanderthals and
                        modern-day humans from different parts of the world. Comparative analyses showed that DNA
                        sequences from Neanderthals were more similar to sequences from contemporary humans
                        originating from Europe or Asia than to contemporary humans originating from Africa. This
                        means that Neanderthals and Homo sapiens interbred during their millennia of coexistence. In
                        modern day humans with European or Asian descent, approximately 1-4% of the genome
                        originates from the Neanderthals (Figure 2).</p>
                    <h5>A sensational discovery: Denisova</h5>
                    <p>In 2008, a 40,000-year-old fragment from a finger bone was discovered in the Denisova cave in
                        the southern part of Siberia. The bone contained exceptionally well-preserved DNA, which
                        Pääbo’s team sequenced. The results caused a sensation: the DNA sequence was unique when
                        compared to all known sequences from Neanderthals and present-day humans. Pääbo had
                        discovered a previously unknown hominin, which was given the name Denisova. Comparisons with
                        sequences from contemporary humans from different parts of the world showed that gene flow
                        had also occurred between Denisova and Homo sapiens. This relationship was first seen in
                        populations in Melanesia and other parts of South East Asia, where individuals carry up to
                        6% Denisova DNA.</p>
                    <p>Pääbo’s discoveries have generated new understanding of our evolutionary history. At the time
                        when Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa, at least two extinct hominin populations inhabited
                        Eurasia. Neanderthals lived in western Eurasia, whereas Denisovans populated the eastern
                        parts of the continent. During the expansion of Homo sapiens outside Africa and their
                        migration east, they not only encountered and interbred with Neanderthals, but also with
                        Denisovans (Figure 3).</p>
                    <h5>Paleogenomics and its relevance</h5>
                    <p>Through his groundbreaking research, Svante Pääbo established an entirely new scientific
                        discipline, paleogenomics. Following the initial discoveries, his group has completed
                        analyses of several additional genome sequences from extinct hominins. Pääbo’s discoveries
                        have established a unique resource, which is utilized extensively by the scientific
                        community to better understand human evolution and migration. New powerful methods for
                        sequence analysis indicate that archaic hominins may also have mixed with Homo sapiens in
                        Africa. However, no genomes from extinct hominins in Africa have yet been sequenced due to
                        accelerated degradation of archaic DNA in tropical climates.</p>
                    <p>
                        Thanks to Svante Pääbo's discoveries, we now understand that archaic gene sequences from our
                        extinct relatives influence the physiology of present-day humans. One such example is the
                        Denisovan version of the gene EPAS1, which confers an advantage for survival at high
                        altitude and is common among present-day Tibetans. Other examples are Neanderthal genes that
                        affect our immune response to different types of infections.

                        Figure 3. Pääbo’s discoveries have provided important information on how the world was populated
                        at the time when Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa and spread to the rest of the world.
                        Neanderthals lived in the west and Denisovans in the east on the Eurasian continent.
                        Interbreeding occurred when Homo sapiens spread across the continent, leaving traces that remain
                        in our DNA.

                        What makes us uniquely human?
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Homo sapiens is characterized by its unique capacity to create complex cultures, advanced
                        innovations and figurative art, as well as by the ability to cross open water and spread to all
                        parts of our planet (Figure 4). Neanderthals also lived in groups and had big brains (Figure 4).
                        They also utilized tools, but these developed very little during hundreds of thousands of years.
                        The genetic differences between Homo sapiens and our closest extinct relatives were unknown
                        until they were identified through Pääbo’s seminal work. Intense ongoing research focuses on
                        analyzing the functional implications of these differences with the ultimate goal of explaining
                        what makes us uniquely human.
