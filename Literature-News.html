                        and has 18 members. The Nobel Committee for Literature is the working body that evaluates the
                        nominations and presents its recommendations to the Swedish Academy, and comprises four to five

                        consideration. Other persons who are qualified to nominate but have not received invitations may

                        literature.</p>

                    <p><span>September</span> Invitation letters are sent out. The Nobel Committee sends out nomination
                        forms to hundreds of individuals and organizations qualified to nominate for the Nobel Prize in
                        Literature.</p>
                    <p><span>February</span> Deadline for submission. The completed forms must reach the
                        Nobel Committee not later than 31 January of the following year. The Committee then screens the
                        nominations and submits a list for approval by the Academy.</p>
                    <p><span>April</span> Preliminary candidates. After further studies, the Committee selects
                        15-20 names for consideration as preliminary candidates by the Academy</p>
                    <p><span>May</span> Final candidates. The Committee whittles down the list to five
                        priority candidates to be considered by the Academy.</p>
                    <p><span>June-August</span> Reading of productions. The members of the Academy read and assess the
                        work of the final candidates during the summer. The Nobel Committee also prepares individual
                        reports.</p>
                    <p><span>September</span> Academy members confer. Having read the work of the final candidates,
                        members of the Academy discuss the merits of the different candidatesâ contribution.</p>
                    <p><span>October</span> Nobel Prize laureates are chosen. In early October, the Academy chooses the
                        Nobel Prize laureate in literature. A candidate must receive more than half of the votes cast.
                        The Nobel Prize laureates names are then announced</p>
                    <p><span>December</span> Nobel Prize laureates receive their prize. The Nobel Prize award ceremony
                        takes place on 10 December in Stockholm, where the Nobel Prize laureates receive their Nobel
                        Prize, which consists of a Nobel Prize medal and diploma, and a document confirming the prize
                        amount.</p>
