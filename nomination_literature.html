            </p>
            <p>
                <b>September –</b>
                <i>Invitation letters are sent out.</i>
                The Nobel Committee sends out nomination forms to hundreds of individuals and organizations qualified to
                nominate for the Nobel Prize in Literature.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>February – </b>
                <i>Deadline for submission. </i>
                The completed forms must reach the Nobel Committee not later than 31 January of the following year. The
                Committee then screens the nominations and submits a list for approval by the Academy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>April – </b>
                <i>Preliminary candidates. </i>
                After further studies, the Committee selects 15–20 names for consideration as preliminary candidates by
                the Academy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>May – </b>
                <i>Final candidates.</i>
                The Committee whittles down the list to five priority candidates to be considered by the Academy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>June-August –</b>
                <i>Reading of productions. </i>
                The members of the Academy read and assess the work of the final candidates during the summer. The Nobel
                Committee also prepares individual reports.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>September –</b>
                <i>Academy members confer.</i>
                Having read the work of the final candidates, members of the Academy discuss the merits of the different
                candidates’ contribution.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>October – </b>
                <i>Nobel Prize laureates are chosen.</i>
                In early October, the Academy chooses the Nobel Prize laureate in literature. A candidate must receive
                more than half of the votes cast. The Nobel Prize laureates names are then announced.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>December – </b>
                <i>Nobel Prize laureates receive their prize.</i>
                The Nobel Prize award ceremony takes place on 10 December in Stockholm, where the Nobel Prize laureates
                receive their Nobel Prize, which consists of a Nobel Prize medal and diploma, and a document confirming
                the prize amount.
            </p>
            <h3>Are the nominations made public?</h3>
            <p>The statutes of the Nobel Foundation restrict disclosure of information about the nominations, whether
                publicly or privately, for 50 years. The restriction concerns the nominees and nominators, as well as
                investigations and opinions related to the award of a prize.</p>
